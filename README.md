# Create Python Modules for Zig easily

- Inspired by [PyO3](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/index.html)
- Inspired by [Ziggy PyDust](https://pydust.fulcrum.so/latest/)

# Progress

- [ ] Figure out how to build a python module with Zig cross compilation
- [ ] Create Module
- [ ] Transform Pyobject to zig type
- [ ] Transform Zig type to Pyobject with easy reference counting
- [ ] Automatic Module registration
- [ ] Easy error handling
- [ ] Create Function
- [ ] Create Class
- [ ] Create Method
- [ ] Basic python build system does not require wheels. Will be able to build on any system with python installed.
- [ ] Testing (maybe) -- With Custom Test runner that initializes python for you
